The Maybe-Why and Sorta-How of Programmable Money
=================================================

From 30,000 feet back to the ground and then getting a rickety plane into the
air on one specific blockchain. Does any of this shit matter? Maybe. Let’s
explore it and see how to tinker with Stellar’s new smart contract platform.

The slides, contained in `index.html`, are built using [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which allows you to write your slides in nice simple markdown and turns them into beautiful, browser-powered slides complete with speaker notes. Read its readme to find out more about it.

There's lots of custom styling on the slides, found at the top of the `index.html` file.
